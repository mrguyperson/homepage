I’m a scientist and data analyst with a Ph.D. in Biology and an M.P.A. in Public Administration, specializing in species movement modeling, ecological simulation, and policy-relevant research. At UC Santa Cruz, I developed decision-support tools for water-resource managers, collaborating across time zones on interdisciplinary challenges. I also bring deep experience as a technical editor, having shaped hundreds of scientific manuscripts for clarity and impact. Whether building models or refining methods, I’m drawn to complex, open-ended problems that require fast learning, clear communication, and thoughtful, systems-level thinking.
